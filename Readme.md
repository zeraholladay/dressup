#Dressup

Dressup is a cutout paper doll game for kids.

The game is configurable so that users can add additional scenes.  

This is designed for little children.  The single click option was slightly too difficult for my three-year-old.  Any mouse click focuses an item.  Only one item can be focused at any given time.  Another mouse click unfocuses an item.  Control-C exits the game.

##Getting started

You must have pygame installed.  I have tested this only under Ubuntu 12.04.

Run the default implementation in 1024x768:

    $ bash run.bash

Control-C exits the game.

##Make your own

See the config for help.  Basically there are just sprites (clothes) and a background (a person to dress up).
