#Dressup

Dressup is a cutout paper doll game for kids.  This software is 100% free.

The game is configurable so that users can add additional scenes.  

This is designed for little children.  The single click option was slightly too difficult for my three-year-old.  Any mouse click focuses an item.  Only one item can be focused at any given time.  Another mouse click unfocuses an item.  Control-C exits the game.

##Getting started

You must have pygame installed.  I have tested this only under Ubuntu 12.04.

Run the default implementation in 1024x768:

    $ bash run.bash

Control-C exits the game.

##Make your own

See the config for help.  Basically there are just sprites (clothes) and a background (a person to dress up).

##Music, Art

The sample music is from http://pianosociety.com.  Cinderella dolls are from http://printablecolouringandactivity.blogspot.com.
